 If you have any suggestion don't hesitate to open an issue, pull requests are welcome too.

## Install

To install type:

```
go get github.com/eduardonunesp/sslb
```

Don't forget to create your configuration file `config.json` at the same directory of project and run it. You can use the command `sslb -c` to create an example of configuration file.


## Usage
Type `sslb -h` for the command line help

```
sslb -h                                                                                                                                                              
NAME:
   SSLB (github.com/eduardonunesp/sslb) - sslb

USAGE:
   sslb [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   0.1.0

COMMANDS:
   status, s	Return the internal status
   help, h	Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --verbose, -b	activate the verbose output
   --filename, -f 	set the filename as the configuration
   --help, -h		show help
   --version, -v	print the version
```

After the configuration file completed you can type only `sslb -b` to start SSLB with verbose mode, that command will log the output from SSLB in console. That will print something like that:

```
sslb -v
